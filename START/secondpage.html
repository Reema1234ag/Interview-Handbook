            <h1 style="font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;">Common Questions</h1>
            <h1>1.Tell me a little about yourself.</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> Start by giving them an overview about your current position or activities then provide the most important and relevant highlights from your background that make you the most qualified for the role. If you’d like, it is generally acceptable to include some light personal details about things like your pets, hobbies or family. Doing so can help you be more memorable and personable to the interviewer.They’re also looking for information about how your qualities and characteristics align with the skills they believe is required to succeed in the role. 
                When you answer this question, connect the dots on your resume so the interviewer understands not just what you've done, but also why.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>2.What are your biggest weaknesses?</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into a strength in disguise!<br>
                For example: "My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone has gone home! I know I should be more aware of the clock, but when I love what I'm doing I just can't think of anything else."
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>3. Why should we hire you?</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> Just Say, I possess all the skills and experience that you’re looking for. I’m pretty confident that I am the best candidate for this job role.
                It’s not just my background in the past projects, but also my people skills, which will be applicable in this position.
                On the other hand, I am a self motivated person and I try to exceed my superior’s expectations with high-quality work. Being a fast learner, I quickly pick up business knowledge related to my project.Lastly, I would like to add that I work well both as an individual contributor and also as a team member.
                Collectively, all these skills put together makes me a complete package for this job.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>4. What makes you unique?</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> To answer, focus on why hiring you would benefit the employer. As you don’t know the other applicants, it can be challenging to think about your answer in relation to theirs. Addressing why your background makes you a good fit will let employers know why your traits and qualifications make you well prepared.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>5.Why do you want this job?</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> The best way to prepare for this question is to do your homework and learn about the products, services, mission, history and culture of this workplace. In your answer, mention the aspects of the company that appeal to you and align with your career goals. Explain why you’re looking for these things in an employer.<br>
                Example: “The company’s mission to help college graduates pay off their student loan debt speaks to me. I’ve been in that situation and I’d love the opportunity to work with a company that’s making a difference. Finding a company with a positive work environment and values that align with my own has remained a priority throughout my job search and this company ranks at the top of the list.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>6.What questions do you have for me?</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> Don't waste this opportunity. Ask smart questions, not just as a way to show you're a great candidate but also to see if the company is a good fit for you -- after all, you're being interviewed, but you're also interviewing the company.
                Example: “What do you love about working for this company? What would success look like in this role? What are some of the challenges people typically face in this position? What do you expect me to accomplish in the first 90 days?"
                </p>

            <h1 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Resume</h1>
            <h1>How your resume is screened</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b> While many engineers can be rather qualified for the role they are applying for, they miss out on getting a shot at the interview as they might never get past resume screening. The main issue was that they do not understand how recruiters worked.

                Before writing your resume, it is important to understand the recruiting structure and how recruiting is done.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>The skill set checklist</h1>
            <p><b>&#8611</b>  These skill sets are typically grouped into "Must have", "Good to have", and "Special bonus".</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>"Must have" — Typically, most of the must-haves include a degree (or not) in a relevant technical field, some years (or not) of experience in a particular programming language or technology.</li>
                <li>"Good to have" — Includes experience/familiarity with secondary languages/technologies which may not be directly relevant to what the candidate would be working on, but could be required due to some interfacing with other components of the project. It could also include softer skills such as being a good team player, clear communication, etc.</li>
                <li>"Special bonus" — Recognized skill sets/experiences which are difficult to come by. Probably not a requirement, but would definitely be useful for the position.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h1>The 10 seconds glance</h1>
            <p>&#8611 When I am looking at your resume, I am doing a keyword match against the skill set checklist. If I see a good amount of the right keywords in your resume, it is a pass. If I need to spend more than 10 seconds trying to figure out what you are writing about, it is a fail. If I see an excessive amount of keywords (much looking like spam), it signals a red flag and goes into the "maybe". Depending on whether I think I have enough candidates for the day, you could eventually go into the pass or fail stack.<br>
                <br>
                &#8611 There are lots of articles writing about how recruiters only spend an average of about 10 seconds to screen each resume. The news is, this is true because resume screening is such a menial, robotic and repetitive task. In fact, many applicant tracking systems (ATS) now are so advanced that they can parse your resume automatically, search for specific keywords in your resume, and score your resume based on the weights pre-assigned to each keyword.
                <br><br>
                
                &#8611 Finding a job is a two-way fit — the company wants someone with the relevant skills required, but it is also important for the applicant to fit in the company culture, and be able to gain something out of their stint. Hence, honesty is the single most important criteria in a resume.
                <br><br>
                
                &#8611 There is a delicate balance between finding the right job vs. finding a job. Getting rejected does not always mean you are not good enough. Sometimes, it just means you are not a right fit for what the company is looking for.
                <br><br>
                
                &#8611 When hiring fresh grads, I know that many of them will not have as much experience as someone who has years of industry experience. Hence, I would look out more for soft skills, such as attention to detail, initiative, passion, ability to get things done, etc. Note: this applies only if you have met the minimum threshold of proficiency/competency in the skill set checklist.

            <h1>10 ways To improve your resume</h1>
            <p>&#8611 Now that you are aware of how recruiters screen your resume, here are 10 actionable ways you can do to improve your resume.</p>
            <br>
            <hr width="820px">
        </div>
        <div class="coverlettercontent" id="coverlettercontent">
            <h1 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Cover Letter</h1> 
            <p> &#8611 I've often received resumes with no cover letters, and I am perfectly fine with it. If you ask me, it is better to have no cover letter than to have a bad cover letter, especially if your cover letter is a "templated" content. An effective cover letter needs to highlight the fit between the job requirements and your skills/experiences. Do not just tell me what you have done in your cover letter; Tell me how it is a fit for what I am looking for.
                <br><br>
                Some small nitpicks:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>Make sure that the cover letter is addressed to the right person (either the name of the recruiter if it is known, or to a generic hiring manager) and company.</li>
                <li>Run a spell check.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h1>Length of resume</h1>
            <p>Your resume should be kept to 1 page or a MAXIMUM of 2 pages. Include only your most recent and relevant experiences.<br>
            Information that a recruiter wants to know:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Name, email, contact number.</li>
            <li>Education details: College, Major, GPA, Sample classes (optional, but if you list, make sure its classes that you scored well in and are relevant to your area of interest), academic awards, availability.</li>
            <li>If you have studied abroad, you can list that too.</li>
            <li>Projects that you have worked on.</li>
            <li>Work experience/co-curricular activities.</li>
            <li>Skills/other interests.</li>
            <li>Street cred - GitHub/Stack Overflow/LinkedIn profile (optional, but highly recommended).</li>
        </ul>
